2. Handling missing values
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a vital tool for gaining insights into employee attrition. By examining data and analysing trends, EDA can provide valuable insights into the underlying causes of employee attrition. This can help organisations better understand their attrition rate and develop strategies to reduce it. EDA is also useful for evaluating the effectiveness of existing strategies and discovering new ones. By proactively analysing employee attrition, organisations can stay ahead of the curve and minimize its negative effects.
1. What are the main factors that lead to employee attrition in this company?
2. Are certain department(s) experiencing higher levels of attrition than others? If so, why might that be?
3. What is the average tenure of employees who leave the company, and how does that compare to employees who stay long-term?
4. Are there any patterns or trends in the data that suggest certain demographic groups are more likely to leave the company?
5. Are there any commonalities among employees who leave the company voluntarily, such as certain skills, job functions, or education levels?
6. What is the correlation between employee satisfaction and attrition?
